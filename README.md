# TicTacToe
building a ConsoleApp tic-tac-toe game using C#

New file added (ticTacToe.cpp) - Work-in-progress version of tictactoe written from scratch in C++, heavily inspired upon the C# code of course..

-----
Only the raw .cs file is attached -- still requires all the project dependencies via Visual Studio (.NETCore.App)
-----
  - Create a method that uses an algebraic function to replace current "threeInARow" method - 10/23/23
-----
"Invalid input" exception handle is not working correctly - FIXED 10/23/23
