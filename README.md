# TicTacToe
building a ConsoleApp tic-tac-toe game using C#

New file added (ticTacToe2.0) containing the game with the if-else-if statements replaced with a switch statement to greatly improve runtime

-----
Only the raw .cs file is attached -- still requires all the project dependencies via Visual Studio (.NETCore.App)
-----
Plan on improving the code as my knowledge expands -- Would love to make code as minimal as possible
  - Create a method that uses an algebraic function to replace current "threeInARow" method - 10/23/23
-----
"Invalid input" exception handle is not working correctly - FIXED 10/23/23
